## NVIDIA / NemoClaw

### ISSUE-001 — Telegram wizard writes invalid groupPolicy value
**Severity:** High — silently breaks Telegram bridge  
**Discovered:** 2026-05-06  
**Status:** Filed — [NVIDIA/NemoClaw#3274](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NemoClaw/issues/3274)  

**Description:** During `nemoclaw onboard`, the prompt "Reply only when @mentioned? [Y/n]" writes `"groupPolicy": "mentions"` into the OpenClaw config. OpenClaw only accepts `"open"`, `"disabled"`, or `"allowlist"`. The gateway process validates config on startup and exits immediately on finding the invalid value, killing the Telegram bridge with no clear error message.

**Symptoms:** CLI inference works; Telegram is unresponsive; `openclaw agent` logs "gateway closed (1006 abnormal closure)".

**Workaround:**
```bash
sed -i 's/"groupPolicy": "mentions"/"groupPolicy": "allowlist"/' ~/.openclaw/openclaw.json
nohup openclaw gateway > /tmp/gateway.log 2>&1 &
```

**Expected fix:** Map `"mentions"` → `"allowlist"` in the wizard or in `generate-openclaw-config.py`.

### ISSUE-002 — Install script fails when piped through bash (TTY error)
**Severity:** Medium — blocks installation, no clear guidance in docs  
**Discovered:** 2026-05-06  
**Status:** Filed — [NVIDIA/NemoClaw#3275](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NemoClaw/issues/3275)  

**Description:** The documented install command `curl -fsSL https://www.nvidia.com/nemoclaw.sh | bash` fails with `[ERROR] Interactive third-party software acceptance requires a TTY.` Piping curl into bash loses the TTY. The quickstart does not mention this or the workaround.

**Workaround:**
```bash
curl -fsSL https://www.nvidia.com/nemoclaw.sh | bash -s -- --yes-i-accept-third-party-software
```

**Expected fix:** Document the flag in the quickstart, or detect the missing TTY and print the workaround automatically.

### ISSUE-003 — Installer does not auto-launch onboarding wizard
**Severity:** Low — minor UX friction  
**Discovered:** 2026-05-06  
**Status:** Filed — [NVIDIA/NemoClaw#3276](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NemoClaw/issues/3276)  

**Description:** After the install script completes, the onboarding wizard does not launch automatically. Users must run `nemoclaw onboard` manually. The quickstart implies the wizard runs as part of the install.

**Expected fix:** Either auto-launch `nemoclaw onboard` at the end of the install script, or add a clear post-install prompt.

### ISSUE-004 — Quickstart documents `--local` flag that is blocked inside sandboxes
**Severity:** Medium — causes confusing errors for users following the docs  
**Discovered:** 2026-05-06  
**Status:** Filed — [NVIDIA/NemoClaw#3277](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NemoClaw/issues/3277)  

**Description:** The NemoClaw quickstart shows `openclaw agent --agent main --local -m "hello"` as the verification command. The `--local` flag is explicitly blocked inside NemoClaw sandboxes with an error message explaining it bypasses security protections. The quickstart should use `openclaw agent --agent main -m "hello"` instead.

**Expected fix:** Remove `--local` from the quickstart example.

### ISSUE-005 — Credential not re-prompted in resume mode after credential reset
**Severity:** Medium — leaves sandbox in broken state after reset  
**Discovered:** 2026-05-06  
**Status:** Filed — [NVIDIA/NemoClaw#3278](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NemoClaw/issues/3278)  

**Description:** After running `nemoclaw credentials reset compatible-endpoint`, running `nemoclaw onboard --resume` skips the inference provider setup step and does not re-prompt for the API key. The sandbox rebuild then fails with an authentication error because the credential is missing.

**Workaround:** Run `nemoclaw onboard` (full wizard, not resume) after a credential reset.

**Expected fix:** Resume mode should detect missing credentials and re-prompt for them.

## Nebius Token Factory

### ISSUE-006 — All Nebius Nemotron models are incompatible with NemoClaw Option 3
**Severity:** High — blocks the natural NVIDIA-on-Nebius integration path  
**Discovered:** 2026-05-06  
**Status:** Filed — [NVIDIA/NemoClaw#3279](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NemoClaw/issues/3279) + [nebius/api#211](https://github.com/nebius/api/issues/211)  

**Description:** All three NVIDIA Nemotron models available on Nebius Token Factory (`Llama-3_1-Nemotron-Ultra-253B-v1`, `nemotron-3-super-120b-a12b`, `NVIDIA-Nemotron-3-Nano-30B-A3B`) are reasoning models. They return responses in `reasoning_content` with empty `content`. NemoClaw's Option 3 (OpenAI-compatible endpoint) hardcodes `NEMOCLAW_REASONING=false` and checks `choices[0].message.content`, causing:

1. Smoke check failure during onboarding (32-token budget exhausted by reasoning, `content` is null/empty)
2. 400 errors when OpenClaw attempts tool calls (not supported by reasoning models via the OpenAI-compatible wrapper)

**Root cause:** NemoClaw is designed to use Nemotron through NVIDIA's own endpoint (Option 1), where it sets `NEMOCLAW_REASONING=true`. Third-party OpenAI-compatible wrappers (Option 3) receive no reasoning-mode signal.

**Workaround:** Use a non-reasoning model — `deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3.2`, `meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct`, or `NousResearch/Hermes-4-70B`.

**Expected fix (Nebius):** Expose a non-reasoning inference mode for Nemotron models via the OpenAI-compatible endpoint, or document the incompatibility clearly in the NemoClaw integration guide.

**Expected fix (NVIDIA):** Allow `NEMOCLAW_REASONING` to be set as a runtime flag during Option 3 onboarding, or detect reasoning-model responses and handle them gracefully.

### ISSUE-007 — `max_completion_tokens` rejected on Nemotron 3 Super 120B
**Severity:** Medium — breaks any client using the modern OpenAI parameter name
**Discovered:** 2026-04-30 (independently rediscovered during tutorial development 2026-05-08)
**Status:** Open — known to Nebius, tracked internally

**Description:** Sending `max_completion_tokens` to `nvidia/nemotron-3-super-120b-a12b` via the public Token Factory endpoint returns HTTP 400:

```
{"detail":"Invalid request. ... [{'type': 'extra_forbidden', 'loc': ('body', 'max_completion_tokens'), 'msg': 'Extra inputs are not permitted', 'input': 10}]"}
```

`max_tokens` (the OpenAI-deprecated parameter name) works. The bug is Nemotron-3-Super-specific — `max_completion_tokens` is accepted on other models served via Nebius Token Factory.

**Likely root cause:** a request-rewriting layer between the public endpoint and the inference engine appears to inject `max_tokens` when omitted, so a client sending `max_completion_tokens` ends up with *both* parameters on the wire. The engine serving Nemotron 3 Super then rejects the request via strict schema validation. The engine accepts `max_completion_tokens` cleanly when called directly without that rewrite.

**Impact:** Any client using a current OpenAI SDK or OpenAI-compatible framework will default to `max_completion_tokens` (OpenAI deprecated `max_tokens` in 2024), and will hit a 400 against this model with no obvious cause from the error message.

**Workaround:** Force the request to use `max_tokens` instead of `max_completion_tokens` when targeting `nvidia/nemotron-3-super-120b-a12b`. In the OpenAI Python SDK, this typically means setting the param via `extra_body={"max_tokens": N}` and omitting `max_completion_tokens`.

**Reproduction:**

```bash
# Fails with 400
curl -sS -X POST "https://api.tokenfactory.us-central1.nebius.com/v1/chat/completions" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $NEBIUS_API_KEY" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model":"nvidia/nemotron-3-super-120b-a12b","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"hi"}],"max_completion_tokens":10}'

# Works
curl -sS -X POST "https://api.tokenfactory.us-central1.nebius.com/v1/chat/completions" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $NEBIUS_API_KEY" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model":"nvidia/nemotron-3-super-120b-a12b","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"hi"}],"max_tokens":10}'
```

**Expected fix (Nebius):** Stop injecting `max_tokens` for requests that already specify `max_completion_tokens`, so the request reaches the inference engine with only the parameter the client sent.

**Cross-reference to ISSUE-006:** the working response in this report is itself a clean reproduction of the reasoning-content failure mode — `content: ""`, `reasoning_content` populated, `finish_reason: "length"` under a small token budget.
